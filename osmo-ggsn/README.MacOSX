OsmoGGSN/Mac OS X notes

Mac OS X support is experimental, please test and report bugs. The
Mac OS X port is tested on Mac OS X 10.3.5, but may also work on
other versions.

1. Compiling

Everything should be straight-forward.  Create a separate
build directory,  run ../openggsn/configure and then make.
If you have problems with configure, execute

$ aclocal && automake && autoheader && autoconf

and then again configure and make.

2. Kernel extensions

You need to add a tunnel kernel extension to your kernel.
The one I've used is available at 
http://www-user.rhrk.uni-kl.de/~nissler/tuntap/
but there are others.  If you want to compile that from
sources (instead of using the binary installer), you
will also need kernel sources from opensource.apple.com.

3. Known problems

None.
