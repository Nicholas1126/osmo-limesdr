About OsmoSGSN
==============

OsmoSGSN originated from the OpenBSC project, as a separate program within
openbsc.git. In 2017, OpenBSC was split in separate repositories, and hence
OsmoSGSN was given its own separate git repository.

OsmoSGSN exposes
- GSUP towards OsmoHLR (or a MAP proxy);
- GTP towards a GGSN (e.g. OsmoGGSN);
- Gb towards a BSS (e.g. OsmoPCU);
- IuPS towards an RNC or HNB-GW (e.g. OsmoHNBGW) for 3G data;
- The Osmocom typical telnet VTY and CTRL interfaces.
