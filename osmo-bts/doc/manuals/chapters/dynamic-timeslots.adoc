== Support for Dynamic Timeslots (TCH/F, TCH/H, PDCH)

OsmoBTS supports dynamic switchover of timeslots between different physical
channel configurations, initiated by the BSC via (non-standard) Abis messages
-- see the _OsmoBTS Abis Protocol Specification_ <<osmobts-abis-spec>>.

The Abis message handling for dynamic timeslots is independent of the BTS
model. However, dynamic switchover will only work for BTS models that implement
the internal API to reconnect a timeslot (_bts_model_ts_disconnect()_ and
_bts_model_ts_connect()_, see also <<osmobts_hardware_support>>).

Currently, these OsmoBTS models support dynamic timeslots:

* _osmo-bts-sysmo_
* _osmo-bts-litecell15_
* _osmo-bts-trx_

Dynamic timeslots are driven by the BSC and need to be configured there. When
using OsmoBSC or OsmoNITB, see the BTS configuration chapter on dynamic
timeslots in <<userman-osmobsc>> or <<userman-osmonitb>>, respectively.
