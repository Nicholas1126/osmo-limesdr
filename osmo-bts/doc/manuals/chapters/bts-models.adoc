== OsmoBTS hardware support

OsmoBTS consists of a _common_ part that applies to all BTS models as well as
_hardware-specific_ parts for each BTS model.  The hardware specific parts are
generally referred to as the _bts_model_ code.

The common part includes the core BTS architecture as well as code for
implementing the external interfaces such as Abis, control, PCU socket and
GSMTAP.

The bts_model parts include support for driving one particular
implementation of a GSM physical layer (PHY).  Such a physical layer
implementation can come in many forms.  Sometimes it runs on a general
purpose CPU, sometimes on a dedicated ARM core, a dedicated DSP, a
combination of DSP and FPGA.

Every PHY implementation offers some kind of primitives by which the PHY
can be controlled, and by which the PHY exchanges data with the higher
layers of the protocol stack in the OsmoBTS code.

The PHY-specific primitives are encapsulated in the bts_model code, and
offered as a PHY-independent _L1SAP_ interface towards the common part of
OsmoBTS.

In addition, each bts_model implements a set of functions that the
common part calls.  Those functions are pre-fixed by _bts_model__.

Each bts_model may offer

* model-specific VTY commands for both configuration and run-time interaction
* model-specific command line arguments
* model-specific control interface commands

== `osmo-bts-sysmo` for sysmocom sysmoBTS

The sysmocom sysmoBTS is a range of GSM BTSs based around an embedded
system implementing the PHY in a combination of DSP+FPGA.  The PHY is
configured by a set of primitives described by header files.  Those
primitives are exchanged over a set of message queues exposed on the
Linux-running ARM core via device nodes in `/dev/msgq/`.  Internally,
the message queues map to shared memory between the Linux-running ARM
core and the DSP running the PHY implementation.

The OsmoBTS bts_model code for the sysmoBTS can be found in the
`src/osmo-bts-sysmo` sub-directory of the OsmoBTS code base.

`osmo-bts-sysmo` has been the primary target platform for
OsmoBTS for many years and is thus the most feature-complete and mature
platform supported by OsmoBTS at this point.

The sysmoBTS PHY supports a direct PHY interface to OsmoPCU, reducing
the latency and amount of primitives that OsmoBTS would otherwise need
to pass through from the PHY message queues to the PCU socket and
vice-versa.

== `osmo-bts-trx` for OsmoTRX

OsmoTRX is a C-language implementation of the GSM radio modem,
originally developed as the 'Transceiver' part of OpenBTS. This radio
modem offers an interface based on top of UDP streams.

The OsmoBTS bts_model code for OsmoTRX is called
`osmo-bts-trx`.  It implements the UDP stream interface of
OsmoTRX, so both parts can be used together to implement a complete GSM
BTS based on general-purpose computing SDR.

As OsmoTRX is general-purpose software running on top of Linux, it is thus not
tied to any specific physical hardware. At the time of this writing, OsmoTRX
supports a variety of Lime Microsystems and Ettus USRP SDRs via the UHD driver,
as well as the Fairwaves UmTRX and derived products.

OsmoTRX is not a complete GSM PHY but 'just' the radio modem.  This
means that all of the Layer 1 functionality such as scheduling,
convolutional coding, etc. is actually also implemented inside OsmoBTS.

As such, the boundary between OsmoTRX and `osmo-bts-trx` is at
a much lower interface, which is an internal interface of other more
traditional GSM PHY implementations.

Besides OsmoTRX, there are also other implementations (both Free
Software and proprietary) that implement the same UDP stream based radio
modem interface.

== `osmo-bts-octphy` for Octasic OCTPHY-2G

The Octasic OCTPHY-2G is a GSM PHY implementation inside an Octasic
proprietary 24-core DSP called OCTDSP.

This DSP has a built-in Gigabit Ethernet interface, over which it
exchanges PHY-layer primitives in raw Ethernet frames with the upper
layers running on another CPU attached to the same Ethernet.  Those
primitives are described in a set of C-language header files.

OsmoBTS implements the raw Ethernet frame based primitives as well as
the associated transport protocol (OKTPKT/OCTVC1) in the
`osmo-btso-octphy` bts_model code.

You can run the `osmo-bts-octphy` on any system connected to the same
Ethernet as the OCTDSP running the OCTPHY.  This can be either an
embedded ARM or x86 SoM part of the OCTBTS hardware, or it can be any
other Linux system attached via an Ethernet switch.

Each OCTDSP running OCTSDR-2G offers a set of primitives part of a
OCTPKT session, which is mapped to an OsmoBTS PHY link.  Depending on
the OCTSDR-2G software version, you may create multiple software TRX by
creating multiple OsmoBTS PHY instances inside that PHY link.

Multiple DSPs may exist in one circuit board, then each of the DSPs is
interfaced by one OsmoBTS PHY link, and each of them may have one or
more OsmoBTS PHY instances creating a Multi-TRX configuration.


== `osmo-bts-litecell15` for Nutaq/Nuran LiteCell 1.5

The Nutaq/Nuran LiteCell 1.5 implements a dual-transceiver GSM BTS based
on a mixed ARM/DSP/FPGA architecture.  The PHY layer is implemented on
DSP/FPGA and similar to that of the sysmoBTS:  It exchanges primitives
described in a set of C-language header files over message queues
between the ARM and the DSP.

This interface is implemented in the `osmo-bts-litecell15` bts_model of
OsmoBTS.  You would run `osmo-bts-litecell15` on the ARM/Linux processor
of the Litecell 1.5.

The two transceivers of the Litecell 1.5 each have their own set of DSP
message queues.  Each set of message queues is wrapped into one OsmoBTS
PHY link, offering one OsmoBTS PHY instance.

The Litecell 1.5 PHY supports a direct PHY interface to OsmoPCU,
reducing the latency and amount of primitives that OsmoBTS would
otherwise need to pass through from the PHY message queues to the PCU
socket and vice-versa.

== `osmo-bts-virtual` for Virtual Um Interface

This is a special BTS model used for research, simulation and testing.
Rather than communicating over a wireless RF interface, the GSM Um
messages are encapsulated over GSMTAP/UDP/IP.

The Virtual Um interface (i.e. virtual radio layer) between OsmoBTS and
OsmocomBB allows us to run a complete GSM network with 1-N BTSs and 1-M
MSs without any actual radio hardware, which is of course excellent for
all kinds of testing scenarios.

The Virtual Um layer is based on sending L2 frames (blocks) encapsulated
via GSMTAP UDP multicast packets. There are two separate multicast
groups, one for uplink and one for downlink. The multicast nature
simulates the shared medium and enables any simulated phone to receive
the signal from multiple BTSs via the downlink multicast group.

In OsmoBTS, this is implemented via the `osmo-bts-virtual` BTS model.

Setting up OsmoBTS in its `osmo-bts-virtual` flavor isn't really much
different from setting it up with real hardware. The amount of required
configuration at the BTS configuration file is (as always) very minimal,
as in the GSM network architecture provides almost all relevant
configuration to the BTS from the BSC.

An example configuratin file is provided as part of the osmo-bts source
code: `doc/examples/virtual/osmobts-virtual.cfg`
