== Control interface

The actual protocol is described in <<common-control-if>>, the variables
common to all programs using it are described in <<ctrl_common_vars>>. Here we
describe variables specific to OsmoBTS. The commands starting with prefix
"net.btsN." are specific to a certain BTS so N have to be replaced with BTS
number when issuing command. Similarly the
TRX-specific commands are additionally prefixed with TRX number e. g.
"net.bts1.trx2.thermal-attenuation".

Allowed SET value for thermal attenuation is between 0 to 40 dB. Note: the value
is SET in dB units but GET will return value in mdB units used internally.
