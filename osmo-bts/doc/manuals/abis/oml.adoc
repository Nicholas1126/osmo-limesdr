=== Details on Compliant OML Messages

[[sw_act_rep]]
==== SW Activated Report

OsmoBTS will send an _SW Activated Report_ when RF has been activated
successfully. The message is compliant with 3GPP TS 12.21 § 8.3.7.

Upon RF activation, two _SW Activated Report_ messages will be sent, for the Object Classes

- Radio Carrier (0x02)
- Baseband Transceiver (0x04)

[[set_bts_attr]]
==== Set BTS Attributes

OsmoBTS will receive a _Set BTS Attributes_ message and reply with a
corresponding ACK message on success. IE handling is fully compliant to TS
12.21, except that a change of BCCH ARFCN or BSIC while in operation is not
supported, and hence the _Starting Time_ IE is rejected.

This message conforms to 3GPP TS 12.21, with the following limitation: the
following 3GPP TS 12.21 IEs provoke a NACK response when sent to OsmoBTS, as
frequency hopping is not supported:

=== Information Elements Overview

All of the IEs handled by OsmoBTS are listed below, with limitations and
additions to TS 12.21 specified in more detail.

==== IEs Conforming to TS 12.21

The following Information Elements are accepted by OsmoBTS.

IEs marked __ignored__ may be sent to OsmoBTS without causing error
conditions. These IEs are skipped during message parsing and are never
evaluated.

IEs marked __ignored__ and additionally marked as being received by OsmoBTS
(<-) are in fact parsed and their values are stored by OsmoBTS, but these
stored items are currently not used in the OsmoBTS code base.

=== Details on IEs

[[ie_hw_desc]]
==== HW Description

TS 12.21 suggests a series of 5 length-value pairs for the _HW Description_ IE.
Instead, OsmoBTS interprets it as a single TL16V. The value of this IE is
ignored by OsmoBTS, yet the coding may affect message parsing.

[width="40%",cols="90%,10%"]

|===
| Attribute Identifier (0x17) | 1
| Length | 2-3
| Ignored | N
|===


[[NM_ATT_ARFCN_LIST]]
==== ARFCN List

Since OsmoBTS does not support frequency hopping, the _ARFCN List_ must contain
exactly one ARFCN.

[[ie_chan_comb]]
==== Additional Channel Combinations

In addition to 3GPP TS 12.21 Chapter 9.4.13, the following channel
combinations are supported:

.Additional Channel Combinations
[options="header"]
[cols="10%,90%"]
|===
| Value | Description
| 0x0b | Reserved for PBCCH + PCCCH + PDTCH/F + PACCH/F + PTCCH/F

The _Reserved_ combinations are not actually supported/implemented
yet, but merely reserved for such functionality, if it is eventually
implemented.

For more information on how the different dynamic channel combinations
work, please see the <<rsl-dynamic-channels>>.

[[ie_conn_fail_crit]]
==== Connection Failure Criterion

3GPP TS 12.21 Chapter 9.4.14 specifies two different options for the

coded as 0x01, i.e. based upon uplink SACCH error rate
(RADIO_LINK_TIMEOUT).

[[NM_ATT_TSC]]

=== A-bis OML Initialization / BTS bring-up

At the time an Abis/IP BTS connects to via OML to the BSC, it is
initialized according to the procedures described in 3GPP TS 12.21 as
amended by this document.

Each Managed Object (MO) is separately initialized.  The initialization
sequence and parameters differ slightly depending on the MO involved.

Some parts of the sequences described below are optional, such as the
Software activation.  In the OsmoBTS case, the software is not modular
and thus all MOs start with the software fully activated.  In effect, no
__Software Activate Request__ is being sent by the MO to the BSC, nor
does the BSC need to initialize the __Activate Software__ procedure.

Still, the full sequences are shown in order to explain the Abis/IP
protocol.

Also, the initial state of the MOs at time of OML connection
initialization is not always guaranteed to be __Disabled/Notinstalled__.
Rather, the BSC implementation has to deal with the initial state as
reported by the MOs at time of re-connection.

==== Site Manager MO Initialization

.A-bis OML Initialization of Site Manager MO
["mscgen"]
----
include::oml-mo-sitemgr.msc[]
----

The Site Manager MO does not depend on other MOs, nor does it have an
Administrative state (__Locked/Unlocked__), thus it immediately commences in
the __Enabled__ state.

==== BTS MO Initialization

.A-bis OML Initialization of BTS MO
["mscgen"]
----
include::oml-mo-bts.msc[]
----

As shown in the BTS MO, its state is

* Availability state __Dependency__, meaning it depends on other MOs to
  be initialized before becoming enabled.
* Administrative state __Locked__, as the object is first waiting to
  receive attributes in the __Locked__ state, before the __Change
  Administrative State (Unlocked)__ procedure is used to request
  transitioning into Unlocked state.

==== Baseband Transceiver MO Initialization

.A-bis OML Initialization of Baseband Transceiver MO
["mscgen"]
----
include::oml-mo-transceiver.msc[]
----

There is one Baseband Transceiver MO per TRX in the BTS.  For a
multi-TRX BTS, the above procedure must be repeated for each TRX.


==== Radio Carrier MO Initialization

.A-bis OML Initialization of Radio Carrier MO
["mscgen"]
----
include::oml-mo-carrier.msc[]
----

There is one Radio Carrier MO per TRX in the BTS.  For a multi-TRX BTS,
the above procedure must be repeated for each TRX.


==== Channel MO Initialization

.A-bis OML Initialization of Radio Carrier MO
["mscgen"]
----
include::oml-mo-channel.msc[]
----

There are 8 timeslots in each TRX, and correspondingly 8 Channel MOs in
every TRX.  The above procedure must thus be repeated for each timeslot
in each transceiver of the BTS.


==== Complete BTS Initialization Procedure

Some of below steps are optional, as is their detailed ordering.  In
practice, the procedures for different MOs may overlap. The message
sequence charts in this document have been hand-crafted to avoid such
overlap for the sake of clarity.

[[oml-msc-1]]
.A-bis OML BTS bring-up (1/3)
["mscgen"]
----
include::oml-startup.msc[]
----

As shown in <<oml-msc-1>>, after the OML TCP connection is established,

. the identity is exchanged via IPA CCM,
. the BTS sends an 'OML EVENT STATE CHANGED REPORT' for every
  Managed Object, and
. the BTS subsequently requests the activation of its 'Site Manager' Object
  which the BSC performs by the 'Activate SW' command.
. After successful activation of the software in the Site Manager,
.. the state changes to 'Enabled', and an event report is generated
   accordingly, and
.. the BSC is notified about the SW activation in an associated report.
.  Finally, the BSC requests the start of the Site Manager
.. using the 'OPSTART' command,
.. which is subsequently acknowledged by the Site Manager.

[[oml-msc-2]]
.A-bis OML BTS bring-up (2/3)
["mscgen"]
----
include::oml-startup2.msc[]
----

[[oml-msc-3]]
.A-bis OML BTS bring-up (3/3)
["mscgen"]
----
include::oml-startup3.msc[]
----

<<oml-msc-2>> shows:

. Software Activation and associated state transitions of the BTS MO;
. Setting of the BTS Attributes followed by OPSTART;
. Software Activation and associated state transitions of the 'Baseband
  Transceiver' MO;
. Software Activation and associated state transitions of the 'Radio
  Carrier' MO;
. Once the 'Baseband Transceiver' MO has its software activated, the
  'Channel' MOs (one for each timeslot) indicate their state change as
  well as software activation.

<<oml-msc-3>> shows:

. The 'Radio Carrier' MO Software Activation;
. The Request to the 'Baseband Transceiver' MO to establish the RSL
  signalling connection to the BSC;
. Subsequent OPSTART and Change of Administrative State on the 'Baseband
  Transceiver' MO;
. The following procedure takes place for each of the 'Channel' MOs:
.. Set the Channel Attributes (such as channel combination),
.. OPSTART,
.. change the Administrative State to Unlocked,
.. followed by a State Change Event Report with the new state.
. After all 'Channel' MOs are initialized, the Radio Carrier goes through
  a similar procedure:
.. Set attributes,
.. OPSTART,
.. change Administrative State to Unlocked,
.. followed by a State Change Event Report with the new State (Enabled/OK)
. All 'Channel' MOs now also report their state as Enabled/OK.
. Finally, the BTS reports its state as Enabled/OK.
