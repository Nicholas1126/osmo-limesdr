[[user_plane_txp_mgmt]]
=== User Plane Transport Management

This chapter defines the A-bis/IP specific RSL procedures that are
introduced in addition to the 3GPP TS 08.58 standard procedures.

In classic A-bis over E1, user plane traffic is carried over 16kBps
sub-slots of 64kBps E1 time-slots according to ETSI/3GPP TS 08.60.  As
the E1 line is a dedicated line between BTS and BSC, no further
addressing information is required.

In A-bis/IP as described by the present document, new RSL procedures
have been introduced to deal with the different properties of
the underlying IP based transport medium.

[[rsl_crcx]]
==== RSL Create Connection (CRCX)

This procedure is used by the BSC to request the BTS to allocate + bind
to a BTS-local UDP port for the subsequent transmission of user-plane
data via RTP.

To do so, the BSC sends the *Create Connection (CRCX)* message.  In case of
successful outcome, the BTS responds with *Create Connection (CRCX)
ACK*.  In case of any error, the BTS responds with *Create Connection
(CRCX) NACK*.

See <<rsl_crcx_msg>>, <<rsl_crcx_msg_ack>>, <<rsl_crcx_msg_nack>>

[[rsl_mdcx]]
==== RSL Modify Connection (MDCX)

This procedure is used by the BSC to request the BTS to modify an
already-bound BTS-local UDP port for user-plane RTP.  It is used in
particular to configure the remote IP address and UDP port to which the
BTS shall send user-plane RTP traffic.  This remote address is normally
either a Media Gateway (MGW) of some sort, but could also be the RTP
socket of the corresponding other leg of a mobile-to-mobile call.

To modify a user-plane connection, the BSC sends the *Modify Connection*
message.  In case of successful outcome, the BTS responds with
*Modify Connection (MDCX) ACK*.  In case of any error, the BTS responds
with *Modify Connection (MDCX) NACK*.

See <<rsl_mdcx_msg>>, <<rsl_mdcx_msg_ack>>, <<rsl_mdcx_msg_nack>>

[[rsl_dlcx]]
==== RSL Delete Connection (DLCX)

This procedure is used by the BSC to request the BTS to delete an
already-existing BTS-local UDP port for user-plane RTP.

To delete a user-plane connection, the BSC sends the *Delete Connection
(DLCX)* message.  In case of successful outcome, the BTS responds with
*Delete Connection (DLCX) ACK*.  In case of any error, the BTS responds
with *Delete Connection (DLCX) NACK*.

See <<rsl_dlcx_msg>>, <<rsl_dlcx_msg_ack>>, <<rsl_dlcx_msg_nack>>

[[rsl_dlcx_ind]]
==== RSL Delete Connection (DLCX) Indication

When a BTS-local UDP connection for user-plane RTP is automatically
released at the time of RF CHANNEL RELEASE, the BTS sends a unilateral,
non-acknowledged *RSL Delete Connection (DLCX) Indication* to the BSC.

See <<rsl_dlcx_ind_msg>>


[[rsl-dynamic-channels]]
=== Dynamic Channel Combinations

In the classic data model established by ETSI/3GPP for A-bis, each
timeslot (channel) is configured using a static channel combination by
means of A-bis OML.  Particularly in presence of GPRS services, this
is very unflexible and leads to inefficient use of air interface
resources.

As such, several methods have been implemented to overcome this
limitation.  The fundamental operation can be outlined like this:

* Configuration of a particular _dynamic_ channel combination via OML
* activation of TCH works like on a classic TCH channel combination
* activation of PDCH requires some specific PDCH activation procedure

There are two variants implemented in the OsmoBTS A-bis dialect:

[[ipa_style_pdch_mgmt]]
==== IPA Style Dynamic Channels

This method is used when OML uses 'NM_CHANC_IPAC_TCHFull_PDCH' (0x80)
as channel combination for the given time-slot.

'IPA style' refers to 'ip.access' compatible PDCH activation and deactivation.

When the IPA style dynamic channel combination _TCH/F or PDCH_
is set, the non-standard 'PDCH ACTIVATE' (<<pdch_act>>) and 'PDCH
DEACTIVATE' (<<pdch_deact>>) procedures are used for switching an idle
channel into PDCH mode and back into idle mode.

When the channel is used as TCH/F, regular circuit-switched activation
is performed, like on any traditional TCH/F.   However, the BSC must
make sure to first disable the PDCH on the timeslot, before activating
it as TCH/F. Likewise, any circuit-switched TCH/F on the channel must
be deactivated using standard RSL signalling, before the specific PDCH
related procedures are used to enable the PDCH.

[[pdch_act]]
===== PDCH Activate

This procedure is used by the BSC to request the BTS to activate an
IPA style dynamic TCH/F+PDCH channel in PDCH mode.

The operation is not supported on any other physical channel type.

See <<rsl_pdch_act>>, <<rsl_pdch_act_ack>>, <<rsl_pdch_act_nack>>

[[pdch_deact]]
===== PDCH Deactivate

This procedure is used by the BSC to request the BTS to deactivate an
active PDCH on any an IPA style dynamic TCH/F+PDCH channel.

The operation is not supported on any other physical channel type.

See <<rsl_pdch_deact>>, <<rsl_pdch_deact_ack>>, <<rsl_pdch_deact_nack>>

[[OSMOCOM_DYN_TS]]
==== Osmocom Style Dynamic Channels

This method is in use when OML uses
'NM_CHANC_OSMO_TCHFull_TCHHalf_PDCH' (0x90) for the given time-slot.

The activation of PDCH is performed by using the regular 'RSL CHANNEL ACTIVATE'
procedure according to <<CHANNEL_ACTIVATION>>, with these modifications:

* The 'C-bits' part of the 'Channel Number' IE take the non-standard binary
  value 11000 (C5 thru C1 as seen in 3GPP TS 08.58 § 9.3.1).
* The 'A-bits' part of the 'Activation Type' IE take the non-standard binary
  value 1111, with an additional fourth bit (add A4 to A3 thru A1 as seen in
  3GPP TS 08.58 § 9.3.3; all remaining reserved bits as well as the 'R' bit are
  coded as zero).
* The normally mandatory 'Channel Mode' IE is omitted; none of the optional IEs
  are included.

Hence the message consists of exactly these IEs:

[[RSL_IE_CHAN_NR]]
==== RSL_IE_CHAN_NR

This information element is coded like 3GPP TS 08.58 Section 9.3.1,
but in addition supports the following extended coding:

* C5..C1 bits 0b11000 for PDCH type channels

The TN-Bits are not re-defined in this case but use the same encoding
as specified in TS 08.58 Section 9.3.1.

NOTE:: The above extension is only valid on an Osmocom-style dynamic
channel, having configured the 'NM_CHANC_IPAC_TCHFull_PDCH' channel
combination by OML.

[[RSL_IE_IPAC_REMOTE_IP]]
==== RSL_IE_IPAC_REMOTE_IP

This information element contains the remote (MGW side) IPv4 address in
network byte order.  It is encoded as fixed-size element with one byte
IEI followed by four bytes IPv4 address.

[[RSL_IE_IPAC_REMOTE_PORT]]
==== RSL_IE_IPAC_REMOTE_PORT

This information element contains the remote (MGW side) UDP port in
network byte order.  It is encoded as fixed-size element with one byte
IEI followed by two bytes UDP port number.

[[RSL_IE_IPAC_LOCAL_PORT]]
==== RSL_IE_IPAC_LOCAL_PORT

This information element contains the local (BTS side) IPv4 address in
network byte order.  It is encoded as fixed-size element with one byte
IEI followed by two bytes UDP port number.

[[RSL_IE_IPAC_SPEECH_MODE]]
==== RSL_IE_IPAC_SPEECH_MODE

This information element encodes the speech mode.  It is set according
to the voice codec used on the connection.  It is encoded as a fixed-size
element of two bytes, with one byte IEI followed by one byte Speech mode
indicator.

.A-bis/IP Speech Mode Indicator Values
[options="header",width="40%",cols="20%,80%"]
|===
| Value | Description
| 0x00 | TCH/F with FR codec
| 0x01 | TCH/F with EFR codec
| 0x02 | TCH/F with AMR codec
| 0x03 | TCH/H with HR codec
| 0x05 | TCH/H with AMR codec
|===

[[RSL_IE_IPAC_LOCAL_IP]]
==== RSL_IE_IPAC_LOCAL_IP

This information element contains the local (BTS side) IPv4 address in
network byte order.  It is encoded as fixed-size element with one byte
IEI followed by four bytes IPv4 address.

[[RSL_IE_IPAC_CONN_STAT]]
==== RSL_IE_IPAC_CONN_STAT

This information element contains statistics about the RTP connection.

It is encoded as 29 bytes, with the first byte as IEI and 28 bytes
fixed-length payload encoded as follows:

.A-bis/IP Connection Statistics
[options="header",width="60%",cols="15%,15%,70%"]
|===
| Offset | Size | Description
| 0 | 4 | Total number of RTP packets sent
| 4 | 4 | Total number of octets sent
| 8 | 4 | Total number of RTP packets received
| 12 | 4 | Total number of octets received
| 16 | 4 | Total number of lost packets in Rx direction
| 20 | 4 | Inter-arrival Jitter
| 24 | 4 | Average transmission delay
|===

All the above values are encoded in network byte order.

A detailed definition of the individual values is given in RFC 1889.

[[RSL_IE_IPAC_CONN_ID]]
==== RSL_IE_IPAC_CONN_ID

This IE is a TV with a value length of two bytes. The value is a 16 bit
connection ID in network byte order.


[[RSL_IE_IPAC_RTP_PAYLOAD2]]
==== RSL_IE_IPAC_RTP_PAYLOAD2

This information element contains the RTP payload identifier, which is
used in the PT (Payload Type) field of the RTP header in subsequent
transmissions of the RTP flow.

=== A-bis RSL Initialization / BTS bring-up

Upon receiving the 'IPA RSL CONNECT' OML message by the respective
'Baseband Transceiver' MO, the BTS proceeds with establishing a separate
TCP connection for the given TRX.

[[rsl-msc-pri]]
.A-bis RSL BTS bring-up for primary TRX
["mscgen"]
----
include::rsl-startup-pri.msc[]
----

[[rsl-msc-sec]]
.A-bis RSL BTS bring-up for secondary TRXs
["mscgen"]
----
include::rsl-startup-sec.msc[]
----

The initialization of the primary and secondary TRX slightly differ, as
illustrated by the differences of <<rsl-msc-pri>> and <<rsl-msc-sec>>.
Since the secondary TRX has no BCCH, it does not (need to) receive any 'RSL
BCCH INFORMATION' messages from the BSC.
