== Configuring OsmTRX

OsmoTRX will read the configuration at startup time and configure the
transceiver accordingly after validating the configuration.

OsmoTRX can handle several TRX channels, but at least one must be configured in
order to be able to start it successfully. Channels must be present in the
configuration file in incremental order, starting from 0 and be consecutive.

Example configuration files for different devices and setups can be found in
`doc/examples/` in 'osmo-trx' git repository.

=== Documented example

.Example: Static GGSN/APN configuration (single catch-all GGSN)
----

 bind-ip 127.0.0.1 <1>
 remote-ip 127.0.0.1 <2>
 base-port 5700 <3>
 egprs disable <4>
 tx-sps 4 <5>
 rx-sps 4 <6>
 chan 0 <7>
  tx-path BAND1 <8>
  rx-path LNAW <9>
----
<1> Configure the local IP address at the TRX used for the connection against `osmo-bts-trx`.
<2> Specify the IP address of `osmo-bts-trx` to connect to.
<3> Specify the reference base UDP port to use for communication.
<4> Don't enable EDGE support.
<5> Use 4 TX samples per symbol. This is device specific.
<6> Use 4 RX samples per symbol. This is device specific.
<7> Configure the first channel. As no other channels are specified, `osmo-trx` assumes it is using only one channel.
<8> Configure the device to use `BAND1` Tx antenna path from all the available ones (device specific).
<9> Configure the device to use `LNAW` Rx antenna path from all the available ones (device specific).

=== Multi-ARFCN mode

The Multi-ARFCN feature allows to have a multi-carrier approach multiplexed on a
single physical RF channel, which can introduce several benefits, such as lower
cost and higher capacity support.

Multi-ARFCN support is available since osmo-trx release `0.2.0`, and it was
added specifically in commit `76764278169d252980853251daeb9f1ba0c246e1`.

This feature is useful for instance if you want to run more than 1 TRX with an
Ettus B200 device, or 2 TRX with an Ettus B210 device, since they support only 1
and 2 physical RF channels respectively. No device from other providers or even
other devices than B200 and B210 from Ettus are known to support this feature.

With multi-ARFCN enabled, ARFCN spacing is fixed at 800 kHz or 4 GSM channels.
So if TRX-0 is set to ARFCN 51, TRX-1 _must_ be set to 55, and so on. Up to
three ARFCN's is supported for multi-TRX.

From BTS and BSC point of view, supporting multiple TRX through multi-ARFCN
feature in OsmoTRX doesn't make any difference from a regular multi-TRX setup,
leaving apart of course the mentioned ARFCN limitations explained above and as a
consequence physical installation and operational differences.
